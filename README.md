## Computer Science Department Simulation
By John Kulp, Alec Jasen, Steven Roomberg, and Malek Ameli-Grillon

=====

### Software setup

You must have a working installation of Python 3 along with the libraries Numpy, Scipy

=====

### Running a simulation

To run the simulation, enter

```
python runsim.py <number_of_terms> <number_of_iterations> <number_of_terms_to_use_to_generate_list_of_students>
```

<number_of_terms> is the number of terms to run the simulation for

<number_of_iterations> is the number of times to run the simulation with the parameters of number_of_terms and number_of_terms_to_use_to_generate_list_of_students

<number_of_terms_to_use_to_generate_list_of_students> is the number of terms to use in order to generate a list of students to have already existing at simulation start
